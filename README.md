## 🌟 Why It Matters
The idea was inspired by a real challenge: English-speaking friends struggling to communicate with Chinese players in the game. This add-on bridges that gap, allowing players to share strategies, coordinate effectively, and build connections across languages. It’s a tool for making WoW not just a game, but a shared global experience.
